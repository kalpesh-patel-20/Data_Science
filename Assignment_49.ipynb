        "### **Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Elastic Net Regression** is a linear regression technique that combines both **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)** regularization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **L1 (Lasso)** helps with **feature selection** (shrinks some coefficients to zero).\n",
        "- **L2 (Ridge)** helps with **multicollinearity** and stabilizing the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Elastic Net uses a **mix of both penalties**, making it more flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are **two key hyperparameters**:\n",
        "- `alpha`: overall strength of regularization.\n",
        "- `l1_ratio`: balance between L1 and L2 (e.g., 0.5 means equal contribution).\n",
        "\n",
        "You can find optimal values using:\n",
        "- **Grid Search** with **cross-validation**\n",
        "- `ElasticNetCV` in **scikit-learn**, which automatically tunes them.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Combines the strengths of Lasso and Ridge.\n",
        "- Good when features are **correlated**.\n",
        "- Can **select features** and **reduce overfitting**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- More complex (has two hyperparameters).\n",
        "- May not be ideal when data is purely sparse or has no multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **High-dimensional data** where number of features > samples (e.g., genetics).\n",
        "- **Text data** with many sparse features (e.g., NLP).\n",
        "- When **multicollinearity** exists among features.\n",
        "- To **automate feature selection** while keeping model stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Same as in linear regression:\n",
        "- Each coefficient shows how much the target variable changes when the feature increases by one unit, **holding others constant**.\n",
        "\n",
        "However:\n",
        "- Some coefficients may be **shrunk** or even **zero** due to regularization.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Elastic Net does **not handle missing values directly**.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should handle them **before** fitting the model using:\n",
        "- **Mean/Median/Mode imputation**\n",
        "- **KNN imputation**\n",
        "- **Dropping rows/columns** if missingness is low\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Elastic Net can set some feature coefficients to **exactly zero** (like Lasso).\n",
        "- After fitting the model, check:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  model.coef_  # features with zero values are excluded\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "Use it as a **built-in feature selector** in pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q8. How do you pickle and unpickle a trained Elastic Net Regression model in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pickle (save the model):**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pickle\n",
        "\n",
        "with open(\"elasticnet_model.pkl\", \"wb\") as f:\n",

        "- **Save a trained model** so you don’t have to retrain every time.\n",
        "- Easily **share or deploy** models.\n",
        "- Load and **make predictions later** on new data.\n",
        "\n",
