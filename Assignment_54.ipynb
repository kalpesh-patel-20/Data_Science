        "\n",
        "A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features. At each node, the algorithm chooses the feature that best separates the data into distinct classes using criteria like Gini Impurity or Information Gain.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make predictions, the input data is passed from the root node through the branches of the tree based on feature values, until it reaches a leaf node, which represents the predicted class.\n",

        "1. **Start with all training data at the root.**\n",
        "2. **For each feature, calculate a splitting criterion:**\n",
        "   - **Information Gain** (based on Entropy) or **Gini Impurity**.\n",
        "3. **Choose the best feature to split on**, based on the highest Information Gain or lowest Gini.\n",
        "4. **Split the dataset** into subsets based on the chosen feature's values.\n",
        "5. **Repeat the process** recursively for each subset.\n",
        "6. **Stop when a stopping condition is met**, such as:\n",
        "   - Maximum depth reached\n",

        "\n",
        "In binary classification, the decision tree splits the data based on features in a way that separates the two classes as much as possible. Each internal node tests a feature, and each branch represents an outcome of that test. The leaves represent class labels (e.g., 0 or 1). Given new data, the tree routes the input through decisions until it reaches a predicted class at a leaf node.\n",

        "\n",
        "Geometrically, a decision tree partitions the feature space into axis-aligned rectangles (or boxes). Each split divides the space along one feature axis, forming regions that are assigned class labels. Predictions are made by determining which region the input falls into and assigning the label of that region.\n",
