        "\n",
        "#### **A) Artificial Intelligence (AI):**  \n",
        "AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart.”  \n",
        "**Example:** A self-driving car uses AI to detect objects, follow traffic rules, and make driving decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **B) Machine Learning (ML):**  \n",
        "ML is a subset of AI where machines learn from data to improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.  \n",
        "**Example:** An email spam filter that learns from user behavior and patterns to detect spam messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **C) Deep Learning (DL):**  \n",
        "DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks).  \n",
        "**Example:** Face recognition systems use deep learning to accurately identify people in photos.\n",

        "**Supervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).  \n",
        "It learns to map inputs to the correct output using the training data.\n",
