        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "ANOVA assumes:\n",
        "1. **Independence of observations** – each sample must be collected independently.\n",
        "2. **Normality** – data within each group should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
        "3. **Homogeneity of variances** – all groups should have similar variances (homoscedasticity).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Violations Examples:**\n",
        "- **Non-independence**: Same subjects tested multiple times without accounting for repeated measures.\n",
        "- **Non-normality**: Skewed data in one group.\n",
        "- **Heteroscedasticity**: One group has much larger variance than the others.\n",

        "### **Q2. What are the three types of ANOVA, and in what situations would each be used?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "1. **One-way ANOVA** – Compares means of three or more groups based on one factor.\n",
        "   - *Example*: Weight loss across three diets.\n",
        "2. **Two-way ANOVA** – Examines the effect of two independent variables and their interaction.\n",
        "   - *Example*: Task completion time across software and experience levels.\n",
        "3. **Repeated Measures ANOVA** – Used when the same subjects are measured across different conditions.\n",
        "   - *Example*: Sales of stores across 30 days.\n",

        "### **Q3. What is the partitioning of variance in ANOVA, and why is it important to understand this concept?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "ANOVA partitions total variance (SST) into:\n",
        "- **Between-group variance (SSE)** – variance due to group differences.\n",
        "- **Within-group variance (SSR)** – residual or error variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s essential to understand how much of the variation in the data is due to the factor being tested versus random error.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Q4. How would you calculate the total sum of squares (SST), explained sum of squares (SSE), and residual sum of squares (SSR) in a one-way ANOVA using Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Using `statsmodels`:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "model = ols('outcome ~ group', data=df).fit()\n",
        "anova_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(model)\n",
        "```\n",
        "You can extract:\n",
        "- SSE = Between-group variance (`sum_sq` of factor)\n",
        "- SSR = Residual (`sum_sq` of Residual)\n",
        "- SST = SSE + SSR\n",

        "### **Q5. In a two-way ANOVA, how would you calculate the main effects and interaction effects using Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "model = ols('response ~ C(factor1) * C(factor2)', data=df).fit()\n",
        "sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Since p-value < 0.05, you **reject the null hypothesis**. There is a **statistically significant difference** between the means of the groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "### **Q7. In a repeated measures ANOVA, how would you handle missing data?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "- **Listwise deletion** – Drop subjects with any missing value (simple but can reduce power).\n",
        "- **Imputation** – Replace missing values using mean/multiple imputation (adds uncertainty).\n",
        "- **Mixed models** – More flexible, can handle missing data assuming it's missing at random (MAR).\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "- **Tukey's HSD** – Controls for Type I error; used when comparing all pairs.\n",
        "- **Bonferroni** – Conservative; used when fewer comparisons are made.\n",
        "- **Scheffé’s Test** – More flexible, used for complex comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Example:* Use **Tukey’s** if ANOVA shows a difference among diets and you want to know which pairs differ.\n",
