    "i) Encapsulation: Encapsulation bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It protects the integrity of data by controlling access through methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on essential features while hiding complex implementation details. It simplifies complex reality by modeling classes based on real-world entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). It supports code reusability and establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows different classes to implement the same method in their own way."
