        "\n",
        "ANS:\n",
        "MongoDB is a popular **NoSQL** database that stores data in a **document-oriented** format using **JSON-like BSON documents**. It is schema-less, scalable, and provides high performance, making it suitable for modern applications with dynamic and unstructured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Non-relational Databases**\n",
        "Non-relational databases, also known as **NoSQL databases**, do not use the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. Instead, they use various data models such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores. These databases are highly flexible, can handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and support horizontal scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "MongoDB is preferred in scenarios like:\n",
        "- **Dynamic Schema:** Applications with evolving data structures.\n",
        "- **Big Data:** High-volume, high-velocity data that requires horizontal scaling.\n",
        "- **Real-Time Analytics:** When fast reads/writes are needed.\n",
        "- **Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data:** IoT, social media, or content management systems.\n",
        "- **Geospatial Queries:** Handling location-based data.\n",
        "- **Cloud-based Applications:** Leveraging its distributed architecture.\n",

        "1. **Schema-less:** Documents in a collection can have different fields, allowing flexibility.\n",

        "3. **High Performance:** Optimized for fast read and write operations.\n",
        "4. **Document-Oriented:** Stores data as BSON (Binary JSON), which is human-readable and machine-parsable.\n",
        "5. **Indexing:** Supports rich indexing (including compound and geospatial indexes) to improve query performance.\n",
        "6. **Aggregation Framework:** Enables data transformation and aggregation with pipeline operators.\n",
        "7. **Replication:** Ensures high availability through replica sets.\n",
        "8. **Transactions:** Provides ACID properties for multi-document operations.\n",
        "9. **Rich Query Language:** Allows complex queries, including range queries, regex, and more.\n",
        "10. **Geospatial Features:** Supports location-based queries.\n",
        "11. **Integration with Various Programming Languages:** Provides drivers for Python, Java, Node.js, and more.\n",
